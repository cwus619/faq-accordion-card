## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the main things I learned with the styling is how to correctly specify the background gradient - not only the attribute required but also how to set the rest of the page to allow for the colours to display correctly.

An issue that I ran into with the red box in the desktop version was its positioning: as it has been positioned absolutely, it would always remain with the specified left offset upon resizing the window. Considering possible ways of resolving this introduced me to the offset options in JavaScript, which I was previously unaware of. Whether or not this is the best way to resolve the issue is something I intend to look deeper into, and may update my code to reflect any better solutions.

### Continued development

Going forward, I will be looking into better ways of positioning images in a webpage. As mentioned in the previous challenge, I would also like to look into CSS Grid as an alternative to Flexbox. 
Naturally, where possible, I wish to improve my JS skills - I took the opportunity in this particular project to organise my JS into functions, which is something I plan to continue doing. Where applicable I hope to look into other JS libraries such as React, with which I do not have any experience as of yet.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - This helped me massively in making sense of the position and z-index attributes.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I have been making use of css-tricks for several projects recently to review and better understand how flexbox works - I find the guide very intuitive with its visual aids.
